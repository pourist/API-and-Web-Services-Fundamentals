# API & Web Services – Reference Guide

A concise technical guide covering the fundamentals of APIs and the HTTP protocol.
Designed to give a clear understanding of what APIs are, how they work, and how HTTP enables their communication over the web.

This is an ongoing reference and will be expanded over time.

## Recommended Reading Order

### [Introduction to APIs](/docs/fundamentals/api.md)

An overview of what APIs are, how they work, and examples of their use in real-world applications.

### [Introduction to HTTP](/docs/fundamentals/http.md)

An introduction to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, explaining its structure, how it operates as a request–response system, and how it is used in both SOAP and REST APIs.

### [Introduction to HTTPS](/docs/fundamentals/https.md)

Covers HTTPS as the secure version of HTTP, explaining why encryption is needed, how TLS works, and how it protects API communication from interception or tampering.

### [Introduction to JSON and XML](/docs/fundamentals/json-xml.md)

Explains the two most common data formats used in API communication, their syntax, structure, and when each is preferred.

### [Introduction to REST and SOAP](/docs/fundamentals/rest-soap.md)

Describes the two most well-known API styles — SOAP as a strict XML-based protocol, and REST as a flexible, lightweight architectural style. Includes structural examples and a side-by-side comparison.

### [Types of Applications – Native, Web, and Hybrid](/docs/api-access/types-of-applications.md)

Explains the differences between native, web, and hybrid applications, including how they interact with device APIs, their advantages, and trade-offs in performance, access, and cost.

### [Authentication vs Authorization](/docs/api-access/authentication-vs-authorization.md)

Clarifies the distinction between authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (defining access rights), and why both matter in API security.

### [Introduction to OAuth 2.0](/docs/api-access/oauth.md)

Covers the OAuth 2.0 framework for delegated authorization, including roles, flows, grant types, and the use of access and refresh tokens.

### [Authorization Code Grant](/docs/api-access/authorization-code-grant.md)

Explains the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow, including client registration, step-by-step process, example HTTP requests/responses, and security considerations such as state, PKCE, and redirect URI validation.
